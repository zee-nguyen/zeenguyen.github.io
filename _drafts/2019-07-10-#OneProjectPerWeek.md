It has been a while (2 months to be exact) since I last built something and I'm feeling
a little rusty. My days have been devoted to learning Algorithms and solving coding 
problems and though I've not really been away from the keyboard, it certainly brings 
a different feeling when I sit down to build something concrete.  So here it goes! 
I'm committing to build one project per week, however large or small, and 
share what I've learnt on the blog.

For this first week, I thought I'll start with **Tic-Tac-Toe** (quite classic, I know).
This actually has been in my notebook (a page full of ideas for projects that I want
to build some day) since last semester when I was in Object-Oriented Design. It's a 
simple game, but at the same time, it contains logics that requires some thinking
and planning. To add a personal touch, I made it with Harry Potter theme, so yes,
you'll need to make up your mind about which side you are on now.

Let's talk about the game!

Some highlights about how the game looks and what users can do:

* It's a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game between two humans (so you'll want to grab a friend, 
who supports your enemy, of course).
* Select your side
