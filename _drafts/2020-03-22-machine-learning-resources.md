One of the biggest lessons that I've learned since stepping foot in the Computer Science world is that I can never be so sure of an idea or a perception about something [TODO: This doesn't make sense, REWRITE]. When I realized my interest in programming back in late 2017, it took me by surprise. I never thought I'd become a computer scientist... [TODO: Elaborate just a bit more here]

So, to learn from my past mistake, I decide to not discard Machine Learning as a topic that I might be interested in all together, just because everyone says that it's hard.

This year, one of my biggest goals is to conquer my fear of Machine Learning by actually getting to know it. I start out by taking the classic [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) offered by Stanford University on Coursera.

Some tips from my own learning experience

1. Focus on the intuition and big picture

Coursera course is good since Andrew Ing always tries to explain the intuition behind the math.

Don't let the complicated math scare you. Understand the intuition.

2.

3.


Here is a collection of some good resources/articles that help me dive deeper and improve my understanding of this challenging topic:

[Neural networks and back-propagation explained in a simple way](https://medium.com/datathings/neural-networks-and-backpropagation-explained-in-a-simple-way-f540a3611f5e)

Clear and intuitive explanation of the topic. Really good explanation of derivative (hence also help with the concept of gradient descent), for those who are scared (TODO: another word) by math.
