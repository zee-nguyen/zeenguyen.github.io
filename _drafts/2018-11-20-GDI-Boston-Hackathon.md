I recently had the chance to attend one of my first "real" hackathon hosted by Girl Develop It Boston and Audible. It was a three day weekend event that brought together many amazing people from all over Massachusetts and even other states. Not only did I learn so much in less than 36 hours but I also made friends with many inspiring ladies. 

The hackathon started out on Friday with check-in and 3-hour workshops of various different topics. We signed up ahead of time for the topics that we wanted to learn about, and I chose an Alexa workshop. I have heard all about Alexa of course, but I never had a chance to explore and see how an Alexa app is built from (somewhat) scatch. So, without that 3-hour window, we we introduced to the world of Alexa and supporting tools to put together a simple Alexa app. It was really cool to work with audio and voice recognition for the first time.
