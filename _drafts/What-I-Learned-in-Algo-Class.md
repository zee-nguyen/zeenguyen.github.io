title: What I've Learned in Algo/ System Class

This Spring semester, I'm taking Object-Oriented Design and what looks like a combination of Intro to Algorithm and Intro to System class. Each half is almost 2 months long, packed with tons of stuff. I already gained so much new knowledge after the first week of school, which I was thrilled about. 

This is an on-going post about what I have learned in my Intro to Algo and System class, together with a few notes of what to learn next and such. Each week, I'm going to update it with new materials to keep track of my progress. 


#### Week 1

- I reunited with C (the last time was about 2 years ago, during <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50</a>), this time, with great joy. I used to be terrified of C and I still am, but it was like meeting an old friend again. I believe we'll get along just fine.
- I learned to install a virtual machine (VirtualBox and Ubuntu). 
- I learned to use SSH and work with remote machine. 
- ~ Research vim + tmux workflow setup
- ~ Master terminal commands + shortcuts

#### Week 2

- We dived into arrays and memory this week
    - Stack, heap, memory addresses, all of it!
- Structs, pointers, malloc
    - Many of the things I learned in CS50 didn't make sense at the time but these topics really start to become clearer (especially pointer) when I go through them again in this course.
    - Something is really cool about asking for memory and responsibly return these memory afterwards :)
- Linked lists
    - I've been reading about linked list in <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms"> Grokking Algorithm</a> and listening to <a href="https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/data-structures-arrays-and-array-ish/"> Code Blocks's Array vs. Array-ish podcast</a> so this week's materials really re-enforce the concept. Can't wait to learn implementing them in a project soon!
- Queue and its implementation
    - Write a queue with enqueue and dequeue functions in C
- Buffer and Circular Buffer
- Working with lab partners
    - This semester, we have a lot more of collaborative projects and labs which is exciting. I learned to tackle problems and work with other classmates.

#### Week 3

- All about sorting algorithms! Super interesting to see how different sorting algorithms approach and solve the problem of sorting a list and also performed time complexity analysis on these algorithms.
- We also saw some new data structures such as trees in general and binary trees.
