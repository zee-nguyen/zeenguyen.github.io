            <p>
                As of December 2018, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/12/17/number-homeless-rises-mass/OAGUA8qjiWmgoaMPsvPQzN/story.html">Boston’s homelessness is up 14%.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully, there are an incredible amount of resources available for the homeless population in our city: from churches hosting shelters, to restaurants giving out leftover food, to libraries providing free educational workshops. However, the information about these support is scattered across different platforms and mediums, making it difficult for those in need to seek support when they need it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to bridge this problem by creating a center hub that provides all the information relating to events that are happening around the city of Boston where the homeless can find resources, food, shelter, clothes and other things in their neighborhood (or elsewhere). Good samaritans, whether they’re homeless or not, can post events or services to the site if they don’t already see it. This helps bridge the gap between analog announcements, like word of mouth or flyers, find a digital home.
