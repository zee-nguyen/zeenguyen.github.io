I recently finished my graduate Algorithms course. Without a doubt, this is one of the most challenging courses I've taken. At the same, I find it incredibly helpful and essential to improving the way I approach about problems. 

After taking notes from lectures and various other resources, I'm putting everything together here for future reference. Below is an outline of the topics and link to each note will be updated as I add it in.

1. Sorting and Searching
2. Sorting in Linear Time
3. Heapsort
4. Quicksort
5. Binary Search Tree
6. Tree/ Tree traversal
7. Graph: BFS + DFS
8. Graph: Connected Components
9. Graph: Minimum Spanning Tree
10. Graph: Shortest Path
