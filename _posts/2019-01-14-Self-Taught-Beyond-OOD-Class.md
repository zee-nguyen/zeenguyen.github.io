title: Self-Taught Beyond Object-Oriented Design Class

As I wrote a post to track my progress in Intro to Algo/ Systems class, I thought I should also do one for my Object-Oriented Design class, although this will contain more information on my self-taught sessions beyond what I've learned in the class.

My agenda is to have a list of things I've learned each week in class and a list of things that I learned on my own outside of the class. I'll be including some links that I find helpful on each topic. Let's get started!

#### Week 1

**In Class**:

- I learned Java for the first time: Primitive data types, some basic syntax, and represent more complicated data in Java
- Functinonal design vs. Object-oriented Design
- Encapsulation
- Access modifiers and some best practices for using them
- Testing in Java


**Self**:

- <a href="https://pc.net/helpcenter/answers/compile_time_vs_runtime">Runtime vs. Compile Time</a>
- Inheritance, interface, dynamic dispatching, and overriding
