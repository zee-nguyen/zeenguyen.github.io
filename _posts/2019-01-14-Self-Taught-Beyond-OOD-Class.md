As I wrote a post to <a href="https://zinguyen.github.io/2019/01/11/What-I-Learned-in-Algo-Class.html">track my progress in Intro to Algo/ Systems class</a>, I thought I should also do one for my Object-Oriented Design class, although this will contain more information on my self-taught sessions beyond what I've learned in the class.

My agenda is to have a list of things I've learned each week in class and a list of things that I learned on my own outside of the class, together with a few notes. I'll be including some links that I find helpful on each topic. Let's get started!

#### Week 1

**In Class**:

- I learned Java for the first time: Primitive data types, some basic syntax, and represent more complicated data in Java
- Functinonal design vs. Object-oriented Design
    - This is definitely one of my favorite topics. Learning about different types of design thinking really broadens the horizon, giving me the opportunity to gain different perspectives when designing a solution to a problem. I'm also drawn to the topic of understanding the people for whom we are designing the products or services (a bit of psychology injecting in here).
- Encapsulation
- Access modifiers and some best practices for using them
- Testing in Java


**Self**:

- <a href="https://pc.net/helpcenter/answers/compile_time_vs_runtime">Runtime vs. Compile Time</a>
- Inheritance, interface, dynamic dispatching, and overriding


#### Week 2

- Test Driven Development
    - I ran into the term Test Driven Development before but didn't fully understand the concept until recently, and it completely changed the way I work. 
- Dealing with exceptions
