title: Reflecting on Bookswap Project
---

<p>A reflection on building my first web application project, <a href="http://bookswap-app.herokuapp.com/">BookSwap</a>. This has been quite a challenge but also a tremendous learning opportunity for me. In this post, I'll walk through the inital idea formation and planning stage as well as my process.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle-heading margin-top-sm">Technologies Used</h3>
<p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB</p>

<h3 class="subtitle-heading margin-top-sm">Idea Formation</h3>
<p>The idea began with me looking around my apartment, finding tall stacks of books lying on the floor. It would be great if I could exchange these books to get some new read, so I though maybe I could build a simple website that lists current books that I own, so if anyone has anything to trade, they can let me know.</p>

<p>The idea started to expand a little. What if I make it available for others to do the same? I know that I wanted it to be a free way to exchange book, or at least, there's no significant cost, so I named the project <i>"Boston Book Trade"</i> and thought to keep it local to reduce the cost. However, I was still puzzled with the <em>process</em> of exchanging books. Do people meet in person to trade or should they bring their books to a bookstore/ specific location to trade? Meeting in person can be incoveninence as it requires schedule coordination and trading at a location requires other process and inventory tracking. I wanted something simpler.</p>

<p class="margin-bottom-sm">After playing around with a few possible solutions, I decided to go with <b>exchanging books via mail</b>. The main idea is that each user will only pay once per exchange. For example, if you request for a book, you will receive it postage-paid. When someone requests for your book, you pay for postage. With media mail, each exchange will only cost about $2.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle-heading margin-top-sm">Stack Decision</h3>
<p>I went with the MEAN stack — MongoDB, Express, Angular.js, Node.js — replacing Angular with jQuery since there was little JS involved. Being able to write JavaScript in the back-end is a big point for me and I've really enjoyed building projects with Node.js. I also used mLab to host the data.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle-heading margin-top-sm">A Quick Overview of My Process</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		With the main idea in mind, I started off with writing out some user stories and sketching out the wireframes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Worked on the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), figuring out the necessary information for each book, user, comment as well as their relationship. A book has a title, author, description, thumbnail, and a genre (which user can select from a dropdown menu). A user has a full name, username, password, avatar, and a short bio. A user can own many books/ comments and a book/comment can only be owned by one user. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Wrote down problems to be solved and broked these further down into smaller chunks of problems to tackle, with reference from the user stories, wireframes and ERD. These problems include things such as routes for books and comments, user authentication and user authorization.
	</li>
	<li>
		Started to build the app with a simple skeleton and random data — no user authentication and user authorization — testing each routes and functionality as I went. Everything was written in one file before being broken down into separate folders. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Once all the functionalities were in place, I started to tackle user authentication, user authorization, and user signup data verification.
	</li>
	<li>
		After most of the basics were covered, I worked on extra features such as search and filter books by genres. Another feature is user's profile page, which is still a work in progress.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subtitle-heading margin-top-sm">Unfinished Work</h3>
<p>BookSwap can definitely benefit from many other features and extra functionalities. This section contains some of the things that I'd like to continue adding to the site.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Users can edit their profile page or update their information.
	</li>
	<li>
		Users can send message to others.
	</li>
	<li>
		Include book condition.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subtitle-heading margin-top-sm">Could Improve</h3>
<p>When I was building this project, I wasn't familiar with a few technologies and practices in the industry, therefore, couldn't take advantage of them. Now that I look back, these are a few things that I could improve in future projects.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use Sass</li>
	<li>Use a CSS class naming system such as BEM (Block Element Modifier)</li>
</ul>
