This Spring semester, I'm taking Object-Oriented Design and what looks like a combination of Intro to Algorithm and Intro to System class. Each half is almost 2 months long, packed with tons of stuff. I already gained so much new knowledge after the first week of school, which I was thrilled about. 

This blog post is an on-going post about what I have learned in my Intro to Algo and System class, together with a few notes of what to learn next and such. Each week, I'm going to update it with new materials to keep track of my progress. I'll also have a happiness indicator that reflect my mood/ feeling on the workload. 


#### Week 1

- I reunited with C (the last time was about 2 years ago, during <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50</a>), this time, with great joy. I used to be terrified of C and I still am, but it was like meeting an old friend again. I believe we'll get along just fine.
- I learned to install a virtual machine (VirtualBox and Ubuntu). 
- I learned to use SSH and work with remote machine. 
- ~ Research vim + tmux workflow setup
- ~ Master terminal commands + shortcuts

Intepretation: Excited but sweating some. We've got a ton of new information and the virtual machine bit is still quite fuzzy to me.
