*An ongoing reflection of the books of 2020...*

This year, I fell in love with reading again while also discovered my new interest in audiobooks (totally a late boomer here, I know). The pandemic situation and working from home open up some extra hours throughout the day to get more work done and even get more reading time in.

This time around, I want to have a place where I can reflect on each book, document the lessons learned, and to come back to when I need a reminder from the wise words of others.

So here it is. Let the journey begins.
